## About dj-camphish

`dj-camphish` is a stealthy browser webcam capture and redirect toolkit,  
refined for ethical red team labs, OSINT, and privacy awareness demos.

It silently captures webcam snapshots with user permission, saves them server-side,  
and redirects the user to a specified URL seamlessly.

## Project Structure

index.html         # Capture page with loader

capture.js         # Handles webcam and image capture

save.php           # Server-side image save handler

redirect.txt       # Target URL after capture

/captures/         # Stores captured images

---

## Setup & Usage

1. Ensure PHP-enabled hosting (localhost, VPS, cPanel).  
2. Upload files and create `/captures/` with write permissions.  
3. Put your redirect URL in `redirect.txt`.  
4. Share the `index.html` URL.  
5. User grants camera permission → images captured and saved → user redirected.

---

## Configuration

- Modify capture count in `capture.js` (`maxCaptures` variable).  
- Change capture interval in `capture.js` (`setInterval` timing).  
- Update redirect URL via `redirect.txt`.  
- Extend `save.php` for advanced logging (IP, User-Agent).
